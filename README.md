# EC2 Pricing Info

Shows an easy-to-compare view of pricing info of Amazon Web Services EC2 instances across various AWS regions.

## Setting up for development

### Pre-requisites

 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

This project uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](https://bower.io/) for dependency management
and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com) as the task-runner. 

To install all dependencies:

````
npm install && bower install
```` 

### Running in dev mode

````
gulp serve
````

## Deploying a prod build

````
gulp build
````

This will generate an optimized build inside `dist` directory. You can deploy the contents of this directory to a static
web server.
